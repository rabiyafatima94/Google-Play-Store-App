App Analysis and Insights - Unveiling the App Ecosystem
\*\*Google Play Store Apps Data Exploration Project\*\*\

Welcome to the Google Play Store Apps Data Exploration Project
repository! In this project, we analyze and explore a dataset containing
information on more than 10,000 mobile applications available on the
Google Play Store. The dataset includes essential attributes such as app
category, user rating, reviews, size, installs, pricing, and more.

### Dataset Description

The dataset comprises the following columns:

1. App: The name of the app.
2. Category: The category that the app belongs to.
3. Rating: The average user rating of the app.
4. Reviews: The number of user reviews for the app.
5. Size: The size of the app in bytes.
6. Installs: The number of installs of the app.
7. Type: Whether the app is free or paid.
8. Price: The price of the app (in US dollars).
9. Content Rating: The target audience for the app.
10. Genres: The genre(s) that the app belongs to.
11. Last Updated: The date that the app was last updated on the Google
Play Store.
12. Current Ver: The current version of the app.
13. Android Ver: The minimum required Android version for the app to
run.

 ### Project Objective
The main goal of this data exploration project is to gain valuable
insights into the mobile app ecosystem. By performing data cleaning and
analysis, we aim to answer several key questions:

1. Determine the most popular app categories and genres.
2. Evaluate the correlation between user ratings and the number of
installs or reviews.
3. Examine pricing trends for various app categories.
4. Identify top-performing app publishers.
5. Investigate the effect of app size on user ratings and installs.
6. Distinguish the most popular and successful free and paid apps.

### Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering

To ensure accurate analysis, we performed data cleaning, including
converting data types, handling missing values, and eliminating
duplicates. Additionally, we engineered new features such as \"Last
Updated Year,\" \"Size Level,\" and \"Price Level\" to facilitate
visualization and understanding.

### Multivariate Analysis

In the multivariate analysis section, we delve deeper into the dataset
to explore relationships between variables. We aim to answer questions
related to the correlation between installations and app categories,
factors affecting app discoverability, and characteristics of
top-installed apps.
